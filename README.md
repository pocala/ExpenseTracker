# ExpenseTracker
 An expense manager for tracking expenses. Users can add, delete and update expense that will be uploaded to a database on MySQL. 

 This project was used as a way to learn more about Python and MySQL. Tkinter is used as the GUI for users to input expenses information for easier management, rather than typing it out in raw SQL code.
